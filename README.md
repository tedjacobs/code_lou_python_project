# code_lou_python_project

This project is to find out what the difference of sports revenue is between the University of Louisville, University of Kentucky and Indiana University for year 2016. And what is the difference of aid between the men's and women's sports at these colleges.  The data was downloaded from the Equity in Athletics Data Analysis website (https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/)

I compiled the code using Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda.
