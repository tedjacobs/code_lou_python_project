This project is to find out what the difference of sports revenue is between the University of Louisville, University of Kentucky and Indiana University for the year 2016 and what is the difference of aid between the men's and women's sports at these colleges.  The data was downloaded as a comma separated values (csv) file from the Equity in Athletics Data Analysis website. (https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/)

I compiled the code using:
  >Anaconda
  
https://www.anaconda.com/

Extensions used within Anaconda
  >Jupyter
  
  >Matplotlib
  
  >Pandas
  
  >SQLite3
  
  
How to run:
  >clone this repository
  
  >open Jupyter Notebook
  
  >locate the file that was downloaded due to the clone
  
  >click python_project.ipynb
  
  >click Cell and then click Run All
  (>you can just click Run to run individually)
  
  
The results will be displayed as a SQL table and as bar charts and pie graphs.  The csv file originally contained data that was not neccessary to the question posed for this project.  After cleaning most of the uneccessary data from it, I left some that allowed me to "pull" just what I needed from the file to create SQL tables.  Creating the tables allowed me to take specific data from them to visualize that data.
